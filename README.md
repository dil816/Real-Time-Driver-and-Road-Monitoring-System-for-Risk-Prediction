## Project Overview

### Research Problem

**How can real-time monitoring of driver condition, road environment, and personalized driving behavior be integrated to predict risks and reduce accidents?**

The Real-Time Driver and Road Monitoring System addresses critical gaps in current road safety technologies by integrating multiple data streams physiological signals, behavioral patterns, environmental conditions, and road information to proactively predict and prevent accidents.

### Key Objectives

1. **Fatigue Detection** - Long-term driver monitoring using HRV analysis and behavioral indicators
2. **Drowsiness Detection** - Multi-sensor physiological and environmental monitoring
3. **Road Monitoring** - Real-time traffic sign detection and weather condition alerts
4. **Behavioral Analysis** - Personalized driving pattern deviation detection

### Why This Matters

- Driver fatigue and drowsiness are leading causes of road accidents globally
- Existing systems focus on single modalities and lack comprehensive risk assessment
- Generic detection systems generate false positives and miss personalized risk factors
- Environmental conditions significantly impact driving safety but are rarely integrated

Our solution provides a **holistic, adaptive, and intelligent approach** to road safety through multi-component collaboration.

The system follows a **modular distributed architecture**:

- **Sensor Layer:** Captures physiological, behavioral, and environmental data
- **Processing Layer:** ML models process data streams in real-time
- **Decision Layer:** Fuzzy logic and weighted fusion for risk assessment
- **Alert Layer:** Multi-modal warnings based on risk severity
